## Linux (and OS X)

#### IMPORTANT: You should back-up your `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim/` directory before install. (Quick Setup will ask.)

#### Note for OS X: You cannat use mouse in Terminal.app, I prefer iTerm2 as Terminal, more powerful.

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Copy and paste this code into your terminal and run.

```bash
curl -k https://raw.github.com/fkadeveloper/qvimrc/master/build 2>/dev/null > /tmp/build.sh && chmod +x /tmp/build.sh && /tmp/build.sh
```
You will see something like that:
